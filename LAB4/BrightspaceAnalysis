For brightspace one thing I would like to have as a feature is the ability to have a revamped calender that uses the dates given in the notifications 
to create events.
so as a student I can easily view all the things I have to do for a given week. Another painpoint I have about brightspace is the
fact that the course schedule does not recognize when anothe teammate has submitted group work, making it always say i have something overdue.

The first issue can be resolved by using the datastream given from the notification drop down to the calender, giving a seemless transition of information
Also having an update to the mobile app where students can have a calendar widget.
