Things I liked.
1. I like the fact that the appetite constraints the time into a viable amount of effort based on the task at hand
2. The defined deadlines as they encourage teams to work towards a defined goal
3. I also enjoyed the process of betting on different features to work on as it gives the feeling that everyone has a say in the team.

Things I didnt like.
1. how the process of somethng to be good/complete changes between a software developer and a project manager. Making it harder to have a standard for quality of the project
2. there should be a different length of time instead of just 2 or 6 weeks to fit more customization.

Open ended questions 
1. would a different appetite length work well?
2. what happens when people do not meet their deadlines?
