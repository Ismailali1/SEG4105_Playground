What things did you do that think were awesome and should keep doing?

We did great team meetings and had actionable items after all meetings this made it easy to know what to expect from different team members for the next week

What are things you think you should stop doing, and why?

We should size the work more properly as some work was too big for a person to do within the next week we should decompose tasks

What are things you think you should stop doing, and why?

Using shape up methodology more often, for this project shape up was used only in the last six weeks of the project

What are things that are affecting your team but are outside your scope of control?

Some things that were affecting us was the fact that the project was done virtually and that affected productivity
